Portfolio + Demo Site

This repository contains my personal portfolio website and interactive demo environment. It will showcase my projects across AWS, Amazon Connect, Salesforce, AI, and customer experience engineering.

Planned features:

- Hosted on AWS (S3 + CloudFront or Amplify)
- Web chat widget powered by my AWS backend
- Project pages: Salesforce CTI, Amazon Connect, SMS workflows, IVR, multi-language support
- Demo dashboards: Contact Lens analytics, QA scores, WFM forecasting and adherence
- Contact form integrated with AWS SES that forwards to Gmail
- Embedded architecture diagrams and walkthroughs
- Links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, resume, and custom GPT

Directory structure (to be created next):

src/     - main front-end code  
public/  - static assets  
docs/    - images, diagrams, demo screenshots  

More features will be added as the system grows.
